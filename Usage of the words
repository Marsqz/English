attribute 属性
In this example，we use only one feature or one【attribute】, namely the tumor size, in order to predict whether 
the tumor is malignant or benign.
在上例中，我们只便用了一个特征或属性，即肿瘤块大小，来预测肿瘤是恶性还是良性。

To recap/wrap up 综上所述，...

To this end 有鉴于此/为此/
【To this end】, we consider a series of theoretical benchmark models and
compare their predictions to our main empirical fndings in Figure 1.

takeaway 主要观点
Our main【takeaway】for theory then is that the joint pattern for net and gross saving rates in the data is inconsistent with 
the benchmark models discussed thus far.

thus far 目前为止
Our main takeaway for theory then is that the joint pattern for net and gross saving rates in the data is inconsistent with 
the benchmark models discussed【thus far】.

subject to 使...遭受
Second, housing is indivisible and【subject to】substantial adjustment costs.

dimension 方面
Housing diﬀers from fnancial assets such as stocks in two【dimensions】.

to what extent 多大程度
We use our model to examine【to what extent】these two features can help explain our empirical fndings, 
in particular that households seem to hold on to their residences in the face of rising house prices.

The prominence of housing in our data leads to another, related question:
【to what extent】do the patterns in Figure 1 point to a housing-specifc story? 

aspect 方面
We show that, by itself, the consumption【aspect】of housing is not enough to rationalize our fndings and 
that other【aspects】of housing, like transaction costs or sustained housing demand shifts must be part of the story.
