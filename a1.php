attribute/property 属性
In this example，we use only one feature or one【attribute】, namely the tumor size, in order to predict whether 
the tumor is malignant or benign.
在上例中，我们只便用了一个特征或属性，即肿瘤块大小，来预测肿瘤是恶性还是良性。
We show below that manyother benchmark models inherit this【property】, at least approximately.
Relative imports use a module's __name__【attribute】to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy.

To recap/To wrap up/Taken together 综上所述/总之，...
【Taken together】, these data contain detailed third-party-reported information on household-level wealth and income, covering
the universe of Norwegians from the very bottom to the very top of the wealth distribution.

To this end 有鉴于此/为此/
【To this end】, we consider a series of theoretical benchmark models and
compare their predictions to our main empirical fndings in Figure 1.

takeaway 主要观点
Our main【takeaway】for theory then is that the joint pattern for net and gross saving rates in the data is inconsistent with 
the benchmark models discussed thus far.

thus far 目前为止
Our main takeaway for theory then is that the joint pattern for net and gross saving rates in the data is inconsistent with 
the benchmark models discussed【thus far】.

subject to 使...遭受
Second, housing is indivisible and【subject to】substantial adjustment costs.

dimension 方面
Housing diﬀers from fnancial assets such as stocks in two【dimensions】.

to what extent 多大程度
We use our model to examine【to what extent】these two features can help explain our empirical fndings, 
in particular that households seem to hold on to their residences in the face of rising house prices.

The prominence of housing in our data leads to another, related question:
【to what extent】do the patterns in Figure 1 point to a housing-specifc story? 

aspect 方面
We show that, by itself, the consumption【aspect】of housing is not enough to rationalize our fndings and 
that other【aspects】of housing, like transaction costs or sustained housing demand shifts must be part of the story.

out of 从...中
If the individuals do not consume【out of】capital gains, 
their gross savings are $10,000 and $10; 000 + 2% × $1; 000; 000 = $30; 000 respectively.

As above 如上所述
As above, households receive a constant labor income w. 

In contrast to 与...不同的是
【In contrast to】above, they can now buy and sell an asset kt at a price pt. 

In contrast 反之
【In contrast】, the net saving rate is independent of stock market performance and predicted to be decreasing with wealth.

relative to 相比于
【Relative】to traditional empirical methods in asset pricing, machine learning accommodates a far
more expansive list of potential predictor variables and richer specifications of functional form. 

For concreteness 具体而言
For concreteness we refer to the asset as “stocks.” 

purged of 剔除
Equivalently, recurrent saving is gross saving【purged of】transitory capital gains, that is ȧ-εa.
We have defned recurrent saving as the systematic component of gross saving or,
【equivalently】, gross saving purged of transitory capital gains.

follow from 遵循
The “gross saving rate”【follows from】(5) and is the saving rate out of total income including capital gains ȧt/(w + r*a).
The defnition of recurrent income【follows from】the requirement that consumption plus saving equals income.
The logic【follows from】the permanent income hypothesis. 

Intuitively 从直观上看
【Intuitively】, since consumption in the two equations is the
same, a diﬀerence in the saving defnition necessarily implies a diﬀerence in the income defnition. 

feature 以...为特征；描述了...
The simple benchmark【features】a household with homothetic utility that
receives a constant stream of labor income and saves in an asset with an exogenously given price.
We next extend the simple benchmark model to【feature】a stochastic asset price.
When returns【feature】a stochastic component εt≠0 and labor income is positive w > 0,
it is no longer possible to solve the consumption-saving problem analytically. 
Formulation (7)【features】disposable income, whereas formulation (8)【features】
“Haig-Simons” income which includes unrealized capital gains.

In turn 反过来（作为“轮流、依次”的含义更常见）
The rich save more than the poor, and the more they have, the more they’ll save. 
Moneythat’s being saved isn’t being spent.【In turn】, that means less work for everybody and a lethargic economy.

be gauged from 由...衡量
As already mentioned, the defnition of “net” and “gross”
saving can【be gauged from】the two budget constraints (4) and (5) respectively.

via 通过
This notion is defned【via】the budget constraint，
where µ is a measure of the systematic, or persistent, component of capital gains.

equivalently 同样地
【Equivalently】, recurrent saving is gross saving purged of transitory capital gains, that is ȧ-εa.
We have defned recurrent saving as the systematic component of gross saving or,
【equivalently】, gross saving purged of transitory capital gains.

themselves 本身
And because house prices are【themselves】a major component of the cost of living, 
one cannot think of changes in housing costs in the same way as changes in the value of a stock market portfolio.

On the one hand,...On the other hand,... 一方面，...另一方面，...
On the one hand, conditional on income, saving rates are decreasing with
wealth. On the other hand, saving rates increase with labor income (see panel (a)), and labor
income and wealth are positively correlated in the stationary distribution.

note 指出；注意
Conditional on age and income, saving rates are slightly decreasing with wealth, as【noted】by De Nardi and Fella (2017).
We also【note】that the least wealthy households
hold a high ratio of housing wealth relative to total assets.

hence 因此
Hence, we will conduct empirical exercises in which we condition on age and labor income.

thereafter 此后
【Thereafter】, from the 15th to approximately the 25th wealth percentile, the
housing portfolio share grows rapidly. 

coin 定义
To simplify exposition, we【coin】this distinct pattern a “swoosh” (in analogy with
the logo of a well-known footwear brand).

nevertheless 然而（转折）
That is, even though the net saving rate is ﬂat, wealthier households do【nevertheless】accumulate more wealth through capital gains.

two-fold 两重的、两倍的、双面的
Our primary contributions are two-fold.

notoriously 众所周知地
But risk premia are【notoriously】difficult to measure —— market efficiency forces return variation to be dominated by
unforecastable news that obscures risk premia.
